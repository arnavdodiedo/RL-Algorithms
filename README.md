# RL-Algorithms
1. RL algorithms demonstrated on GridWorld environment. Currently includes-
    1. Policy evaluation and improvement with DP
    2. Policy evaluation and improvement with Monte Carlo
    3. Policy evaluation with TD(0) learning
    4. Sarsa - on policy TD control
    5. Q Learning - off policy TD control

2. REINFORCE on CartPole-v0 and MountainCar-v0. (MountainCar-v0 is unsolved)
3. DQN on MountainCar-v0
4. A2C on CartPole-v0
