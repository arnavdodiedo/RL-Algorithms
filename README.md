# RL-Algorithms
1. RL algorithms demonstrated on GridWorld (simple maze) environment. Includes-
    1. Policy evaluation and improvement with DP.
    2. Policy evaluation and improvement with Monte Carlo.
    3. Policy evaluation with TD(0) learning.
    4. Sarsa - on policy TD control.
    5. Q Learning - off policy TD control.

2. REINFORCE on CartPole-v0 and MountainCar-v0. (MountainCar-v0 currently unsolved)
3. DQN on MountainCar-v0.
4. A2C on CartPole-v0.
5. Dyna-Q algorithm on deterministic GridWorld (simple maze environment with trap/block states).
